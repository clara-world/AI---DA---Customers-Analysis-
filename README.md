# Customer Analytics Practice Project - Olist Dataset

## ðŸ“š Overview
This repository includes a standard Kaggle customer data analysis project designed to demonstrate and compare the capabilities of two AI-accelerated environments for data analysis:

- Mito on Jupyter Notebook â€“ a spreadsheet-powered Python assistant that automatically writes and explains code as you manipulate data visually.
- Gemini AI on Google Colab â€“ a generative AI assistant that helps with Python scripting, data exploration, and natural language-based code generation.

The project walks through a structured customer analysis workflowâ€”covering cohort analysis, retention rates, and segmentationâ€”using a publicly available e-commerce dataset. The goal is to assess the strengths, limitations, and complementary use cases of each tool in a real-world data analytics context.

The project focuses on simulating real-world analytics workflows, starting from raw data preparation to generating actionable business insights through visualization and modeling.

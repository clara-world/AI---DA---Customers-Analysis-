# Customer Analytics Practice Project - Olist Dataset

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a practice project aimed at strengthening my skills in customer analytics, cohort analysis, and data storytelling.  
I leveraged an AI-enhanced Jupyter Notebook environment (using Mito and Python) to perform exploratory data analysis and customer retention studies on the [Olist E-commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

The project focuses on simulating real-world analytics workflows, starting from raw data preparation to generating actionable business insights through visualization and modeling.
